            <h1><b>Metuchen</b> Farmer's Market</h1>
            <h2>Website & Content Management</h2>
        </header>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> My town's volunteer-run farmer's market was in desperate need of a redesign of their site and for someone to maintain it going forward. I volunteered to help. The site needed to be an information source so patrons could see which vendors were available on which day, find out more about the vendors, and see any special events taking place during the season. It also needed to be maintainable by the market manager so they could add & remove vendors.</p>
        <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I began by meeting with the market manager to more fully understand the goals of the redesign and what he hoped that the website could provide to the community. I began by wireframing out a site map and some ideas for the homepage, event day page and vendor information page. I presented these to the volunteer leadership for feedback and approval. I leveraged the various graphic design materials that had been created for pamphlets, lawns signs, and advertisements to inform my design direction and color palette. I choose to rebuild the site using Wordpress since this is a familiar and easy to use back-end that the market manager could be taught and feel comfortable using.</p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The <a href="http://www.metuchenfarmersmarket.com/">site</a> was redesigned and rebuilt and has been easy to update and make changes to year after year.</p>

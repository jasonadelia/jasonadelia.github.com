            <h2>Mobile Companion Application for Thomson One</h2>
        </header>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Investor relations professionals need to be able to stay connected to their investor base while traveling. The desktop product, Thomson One, was inaccessible on mobile devices and not tailored to the use-case of mobile users.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> The original idea was presented as two simple lists. One for upcoming meetings and the other, a list of the top 100 holders of a company. Through user interviews we were able to determine the key features of Thomson One that IR professionals needed while on-the-go. Through sketching and prototyping we delivered a fully responsive design that included calendar functionality, top holders, and latest research screens. As wireless access could be unreliable, data from the app was made available using offline caching.</p>

            <li><img src="../img/portfolio_irmobile_03.jpg"></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Using responsive design techniques (new at the time) Thomson brought IR Mobile to market allowing IR professional never before available access to critical information on their phones and tablets.</p>
        <h2>Nasdaq Redesign</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> After Nasdaq acquired the Corporate Solutions business from Thomson Reuters, IR Mobile was the first application to re-branded. This was not simply swapping out colors. A complete overhaul of the Thomson One product would take several years. The business wanted to add new features to IR Mobile as a way to keep customers happy and engaged in the platform as the Thomson One application was rewritten from the ground up.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We first looked at the research done during the original implementation. There were plenty of features that were discussed but never implemented. We also took advantage of the ongoing research being done for IR Insight to find mobile use-cases in interviews and surveys. Using that information we proceeded to sketch and prototype new designs that adhered to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.</p>

            <li><img src="../img/portfolio_irmobile_05.jpg"></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The application was successfully rebranded with a Nasdaq theme and the interactions and workflows were reworked where necessary. New features were added which complimented the desktop application, IR Insight.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Investor relations officers needed a way to periodically glean broad investor ownership metrics and dig into the important underlying data for planning and review purposes. The legacy system lacked the ability to save frequently accessed configurations.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> The process began with a survey of 35 existing platform users followed by a campaign of 10 phone interviews. We were able to connect with stakeholders throughout the organization to round out the vision of what story the investor data was truly supposed to tell.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>We employed the design studio workshop technique to generate dozens of sketches in the initial phase. From there, we embarked on several sprints of iterative prototyping, working our way from low fidelity wireframes up to fully functional in-browser prototypes. At three points during the design cycle, we were able to test our concepts with customers and demonstrate our progress to top company stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Our initial framework was very dependent upon a single, one-stop view. After observing users work with the prototype, we learned that a single view was inefficient and cumbersome.</p>

            <li><img src="../img/portfolio_irinsight_06.jpg"></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> We developed a multi-layered model that allows the IRO to quickly scan current investor trends broken down by common reporting structures. When they discover something of interest, theyâ€™re able to tune the output with a set of contextual filters. They may also opt to save a particular data view and filter set for future reference instead of having to reconfigure inputs upon re-entering the investors section.</p>

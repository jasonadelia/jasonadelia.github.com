            <h2>Research Tracking Platform</h2>
        </header>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Nasdaq Product Design's research practice is small and distributed, but very active. We needed a solution to keep track of our numerous research campaigns and share them with our fellow designers as well as product management and senior leadership. We had been using basecamp, dropbox, and email but what we really needed was one central location to manage our research findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We looked around the market to find a product that fit our needs. Finding none, we decided to build our own. We built Mosaiq on top of Wordpress because we wanted to have a back-end solution that was familiar and easy to customize. Working with the research team we produced data input screens to capture all the information they needed to be able to record.</p>

            <li><img src="../img/portfolio_mosaiq_02.jpg"></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> After successfully using Mosaiq within our own organization, we decided to make it open source and released it to the entire design community. We built a <a href="http://nasdaqdesign.com/mosaiq/">marketing site</a>, created a video demo, and hosted the <a href="https://github.com/NasdaqDesign/mosaiq">source code</a> on github.</p>
